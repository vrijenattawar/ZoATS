**JOB:** {job_id}
**CANDIDATE:** {candidate_id}

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:**
- This is semantic evaluation, NOT keyword matching
- Recognize DIRECT experience (e.g., former McKinsey employee applying to McKinsey = very strong)
- Map TRANSFERABLE skills (e.g., "career coaching" â†’ "client engagement", but note it)
- Identify POTENTIAL (e.g., trajectory, learning velocity)
- Flag when making inference vs. seeing direct evidence

**RUBRIC CRITERIA:**
{json.dumps(rubric['criteria'], indent=2)}

**RESUME:**
{resume_text}

---

**TASK:**
Score each criterion 0-10 with this guidance:
- **9-10**: Exceptional - exceeds requirements, clear mastery
- **7-8**: Strong - solid experience, meets requirements fully
- **5-6**: Moderate - some evidence, may need development
- **3-4**: Limited - minimal evidence
- **0-2**: No evidence or irrelevant

For EACH criterion, provide:
1. **score** (0-10)
2. **evidence** (verbatim excerpt from resume, <100 chars)
3. **reasoning** (1-2 sentences explaining score)
4. **match_type**: "direct" | "transferable" | "potential" | "none"
5. **transferable_note** (if match_type=transferable, explain the mapping)

**SPECIAL ATTENTION:**
- If candidate has DIRECT company experience (e.g., worked at this exact company before), flag this prominently
- If candidate shows STRONG TRAJECTORY (rapid promotions, increasing scope), note this
- If candidate has PROVEN OUTCOMES in similar contexts, weight this heavily

**META-SIGNALS** (evaluate holistically):
1. **trajectory**: "ascending" | "flat" | "declining" - career progression pattern
2. **achievement_density**: "high" | "moderate" | "low" - quantified outcomes per role
3. **narrative_coherence**: "strong" | "moderate" | "weak" - logical career story
4. **learning_velocity**: "fast" | "moderate" | "slow" - speed of skill/domain acquisition

**RED FLAGS** (identify if present):
- Overselling (claims not backed by evidence)
- Inconsistencies (timeline gaps, contradictions)
- Job hopping (many short stints without clear reason)
- Lack of measurable impact
