# ZoATS Maybe Email Composer

**Purpose:** Generate individualized clarification emails for candidates with MAYBE decisions.

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

---

## Overview

When the gestalt scorer assigns a MAYBE decision, it includes `clarification_questions` that need to be addressed before advancing to interview. This worker automates the generation of professional, supportive clarification emails.

---

## Features

✅ **Decision-aware:** Only generates emails for MAYBE decisions  
✅ **Individualized:** Pulls candidate name/email from parsed data  
✅ **Professional tone:** Supportive, encouraging, legally compliant  
✅ **Automatic deadline:** 7-day response window  
✅ **Dry-run mode:** Preview before writing  
✅ **Robust error handling:** Validates all inputs  
✅ **Logging:** Full visibility into generation process

---

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- Reads gestalt_evaluation.json for decision and clarification questions
- Extracts candidate name/email from parsed/fields.json
- Generates individualized emails per candidate
- Only triggers for MAYBE decisions (skips others gracefully)
- **Careerspan recommendation**: Includes helpful guidance about using Careerspan (www.mycareerspan.com) to craft responses
- Automatic deadline calculation (7 days)
- Professional, supportive, legally compliant tone

## Email Template Structure

1. **Professional greeting** (first name)
2. **Thank you and acknowledgment**
3. **Clarification questions** (numbered, from gestalt)
4. **Careerspan recommendation section**:
   - Explains how Careerspan helps candidates craft better responses
   - Encourages using the platform to develop answers
   - Notes that candidates can copy Careerspan answers directly into their response
   - Emphasizes it's free and helps candidates shine
5. **Purpose explanation and deadline**
6. **Contact info and professional sign-off**

---

## Design Principles

### Tone: Supportive & Encouraging
- "We're impressed by your experience"
- "Help us understand how your skills align"
- "Give you the best opportunity to showcase your strengths"
- "Areas where you can really shine"
- "Genuinely interested in understanding the full scope of your capabilities"

### Legal Compliance
- No discriminatory questions
- Focus on job-relevant information
- Optional format ("no strict format")
- Clear deadline with reasonable timeframe
- Contact info for clarification

### Individualization
- Uses candidate's actual name (first name basis)
- Uses their actual email
- References actual job title and company
- Includes their specific clarification questions from gestalt evaluation

---

## Behavior by Decision Type

| Decision | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| MAYBE | Generate clarification email |
| STRONG_INTERVIEW | Skip (log "no clarification needed") |
| INTERVIEW | Skip (log "no clarification needed") |
| PASS | Skip (log "no clarification needed") |

---

## Testing

### Test with Synthetic MAYBE Candidate
```bash
# Test candidate created at:
# jobs/mckinsey-associate-15264/candidates/test_maybe/

python workers/maybe_email/main.py \
  --job mckinsey-associate-15264 \
  --candidate test_maybe \
  --dry-run
```

### Verify Output
```bash
cat jobs/mckinsey-associate-15264/candidates/test_maybe/outputs/clarification_email.md
```

---

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Missing job description → Uses default placeholders
- No clarification questions → Skips email generation
- Invalid JSON → Clear error message with file path

### Exit Codes
- `0`: Success (email generated or skipped appropriately)
- `1`: Error (file not found, invalid JSON, unexpected exception)

---

## Integration with Pipeline

### Typical Flow
```
Parser → Quick Test → Gestalt Scorer → Dossier Generator → Maybe Email Composer
                                              ↓
                                    decision == "MAYBE"
                                              ↓
                                      clarification_email.md
```

### Future Enhancements
- **Employer approval workflow:** Review emails before sending
- **Batch generation:** Process all MAYBE candidates at once
- **Email sending:** Integration with Gmail/SendGrid
- **Response tracking:** Log when candidates respond
- **Template customization:** Per-company email templates

---

## Architecture

### Code Structure
- **Input validation:** Verify all required files exist
- **Data extraction:** Parse candidate info, job info, questions
- **Email composition:** Generate individualized message
- **Output:** Write to .md file with logging

### Line Count
152 lines (well within 100-150 target, expanded for robustness)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: MAYBE with 3 Questions
```
Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your application to the Associate position at McKinsey & Company...

1. Can you describe a project where you led strategic decision-making...
2. Your resume mentions 'stakeholder management'—could you walk us through...
3. We noticed a 6-month gap between your roles...

Please share your responses by October 31, 2025.
```

### Example 2: Non-MAYBE Decision
```
2025-10-24T03:04:31Z INFO Decision: STRONG_INTERVIEW
2025-10-24T03:04:31Z INFO Skipping: Decision is STRONG_INTERVIEW, not MAYBE
2025-10-24T03:04:31Z INFO ✓ No clarification email needed
```
