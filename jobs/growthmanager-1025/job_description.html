We're seeking someone who leads with humility, pursues audacious goals, and is motivated by meaningful impact on people and the world.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At FutureFit AI, our core mission is to help more people get to better jobs faster and cheaper, with a specific focus on those facing barriers to opportunity. Our work helps resolve the growing issue of economic inequality, ensuring that no one is left behind in the future of work. Our AI-powered platform brings efficiency and insight to workforce development, replacing outdated systems and unlocking human potential at scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ready to make an impact? Apply today.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Important note: Data shows that men typically apply when meeting 3/10 requirements, while women often wait until it's 10/10. We encourage you to apply if you see a strong (not necessarily perfect) fit.</em></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your Role</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a <strong>Growth Manager</strong> who loves wearing many hats and turning ideas into measurable revenue. This role spans strategy, execution, and systems building — you’ll design and run the campaigns, processes, and experiments that fuel predictable growth across the US and Canada.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll move fluidly between building and optimizing tech systems, launching multi-channel campaigns, developing partnerships, and supporting sales initiatives. One week you might be setting up a CRM workflow or coordinating an event; the next, analyzing data to refine our demand strategy or collaborating with a branding agency.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a hands-on role for someone who likes connecting the dots, learning fast, and taking ownership of growth from insight to revenue. You’ll bring strong operational instincts, a marketing mindset, and the ability to translate ideas into results.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What You’ll Own</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Evolve and run FutureFit AI’s demand engine</strong> — designing and executing multi-channel campaigns that generate predictable, high-quality pipeline across priority markets.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Shape and operationalize FutureFit AI’s market focus</strong> — evolving ICPs, refining messaging, and translating insights into targeted, high-performing demand generation campaigns.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Connect the dots between brand, data, and execution</strong> — maintaining GTM rhythms, reporting, and storytelling that align how FutureFit AI shows up across channels, measures success, and drives growth.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Plan and execute FutureFit AI’s event marketing strategy</strong> — from identifying priority industry events to coordinating logistics, booth setup, collateral, and lead follow-up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Support top-of-funnel sales activity</strong> — supporting early prospect engagement, preparing materials and follow-ups for live deals, and joining introductory calls as needed to ensure a seamless experience from lead to opportunity.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Required Experience</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">3–5+ years of experience in GTM, growth marketing, or revenue operations within early- or growth-stage B2B SaaS companies.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proven track record of owning demand generation and pipeline performance with measurable impact on revenue outcomes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong experience designing and running multi-channel campaigns (email, outbound, events, partnerships) that generate and advance qualified leads.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Excellent written communication skills with ability to translate market learnings into refined messaging and materials (decks, one-pagers, case studies, blog content).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proficiency with CRM and marketing automation tools (Clarify, HubSpot, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"http://Customer.io\">Customer.io</a>, Clay, Lemlist, Grain, or equivalents) and the discipline to use data to guide GTM decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong project management and organizational skills — can set up systems, track progress, and ensure follow-through across multiple stakeholders.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Analytical and data-driven, with a clear understanding of funnel metrics to measure impact and guide decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">High ownership and bias for action: takes initiative, anticipates needs, and moves from idea to implementation quickly.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience in workforce development, government technology, or economic development sectors.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience in management consulting (a common background for our team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Familiarity with AI or data-enabled platforms and their application in B2B or social impact contexts.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Exposure to brand strategy, design coordination, or content marketing for mission-driven tech.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Basic understanding of sales funnel forecasting and attribution.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your Education</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your alma mater isn’t our focus.

For this role, that might look like:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Online Application</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Initial Screen with Director of People &amp; Culture</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Hiring Manager</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Performance Challenge</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Presentation to Go-To-Market panel</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">1:1 Interviews with Growth Team</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final Interview with CEO</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final Decision</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Generally, this entire process takes around 6 weeks, although the timing can vary due to specific candidate and team circumstances.</em></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Ready to shape the future of work?</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At FutureFit AI, we're not just building a company—we're transforming how talent and opportunity connect. Join our driven team united by a commitment to job seekers and the workforce ecosystems we serve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Company Snapshot:</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Team: </strong>30-50 across US and Canada (hubs in NYC and Toronto)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Customers: </strong>Workforce development agencies and intermediaries, government agencies, employers</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Industry:</strong> SaaS/AI technology</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Funding:</strong> Bootstrapped 0-1, then raised funding led by JP Morgan</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Structure: </strong>Growth, Customer Success, Product, Engineering, Data, People &amp; Culture, Finance &amp; Operations</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Our Core Principles</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Be Curious</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Drive to Outcomes</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Raise the Bar</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Speed Matters</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Own It</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We Over Me</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Use of AI in Hiring</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At FutureFit, we use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to make our hiring process more efficient, consistent, and equitable—never to replace human judgment. We use AI in the following ways:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Screening support:</strong> AI may help us compare applications against the skills and experience required for a specific role. These skills are defined by the hiring team for each position. A human reviews each application, with the AI assessment as just one input. </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Interview support:</strong> In some interviews, we may use an AI notetaker to summarize the discussion so interviewers can focus on being present in the conversation.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Insights, not decisions:</strong> AI provides data points to support our team’s evaluation but does not make or recommend final hiring decisions. Every hiring decision is made by people.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, perform essential job functions, and receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please contact us to request an accommodation.</em><br /><br /><em><strong>© </strong>FutureFit AI All rights reserved, we are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

This role spans strategy, execution, and systems building — you’ll design and run the campaigns, processes, and experiments that fuel predictable growth across the US and Canada.\n\nYou’ll move fluidly between building and optimizing tech systems, launching multi-channel campaigns, developing partnerships, and supporting sales initiatives. One week you might be setting up a CRM workflow or coordinating an event; the next, analyzing data to refine our demand strategy or collaborating with a branding agency.\n\nThis is a hands-on role for someone who likes connecting the dots, learning fast, and taking ownership of growth from insight to revenue. You’ll bring strong operational instincts, a marketing mindset, and the ability to translate ideas into results.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL OWN\n\n - Evolve and run FutureFit AI’s demand engine — designing and executing multi-channel campaigns that generate predictable, high-quality pipeline across priority markets.\n\n - Shape and operationalize FutureFit AI’s market focus — evolving ICPs, refining messaging, and translating insights into targeted, high-performing demand generation campaigns.\n\n - Connect the dots between brand, data, and execution — maintaining GTM rhythms, reporting, and storytelling that align how FutureFit AI shows up across channels, measures success, and drives growth.\n\n - Plan and execute FutureFit AI’s event marketing strategy — from identifying priority industry events to coordinating logistics, booth setup, collateral, and lead follow-up.\n\n - Support top-of-funnel sales activity — supporting early prospect engagement, preparing materials and follow-ups for live deals, and joining introductory calls as needed to ensure a seamless experience from lead to opportunity.\n\n\nREQUIRED EXPERIENCE\n\n - 3–5+ years of experience in GTM, growth marketing, or revenue operations within early- or growth-stage B2B SaaS companies.\n\n - Proven track record of owning demand generation and pipeline performance with measurable impact on revenue outcomes.\n\n - Strong experience designing and running multi-channel campaigns (email, outbound, events, partnerships) that generate and advance qualified leads.\n\n - Excellent written communication skills with ability to translate market learnings into refined messaging and materials (decks, one-pagers, case studies, blog content).\n\n - Proficiency with CRM and marketing automation tools (Clarify, HubSpot, Customer.io http://Customer.io, Clay, Lemlist, Grain, or equivalents) and the discipline to use data to guide GTM decisions.\n\n - Strong project management and organizational skills — can set up systems, track progress, and ensure follow-through across multiple stakeholders.\n\n - Analytical and data-driven, with a clear understanding of funnel metrics to measure impact and guide decisions.\n\n - High ownership and bias for action: takes initiative, anticipates needs, and moves from idea to implementation quickly.\n\n\nBONUS POINTS\n\n - Experience in workforce development, government technology, or economic development sectors.\n\n - Experience in management consulting (a common background for our team).\n\n - Familiarity with AI or data-enabled platforms and their application in B2B or social impact contexts.\n\n - Exposure to brand strategy, design coordination, or content marketing for mission-driven tech.\n\n - Basic understanding of sales funnel forecasting and attribution.\n\n\nYOUR EDUCATION\n\nYour alma mater isn’t our focus. Your grit, hunger, and drive are. If you learn continuously, tackle challenges head-on, and know your strengths and gaps intimately—you’re our person.\n\n\nLOCATION\n\nWe are open to candidates living anywhere in the US or Canada. For candidates living in New York City, our office is at 18 W 18th Street. For candidates living in Toronto, our office is conveniently located at 325 Front St West (a short walk from Union Station). You are welcome to come in on a hybrid schedule.\n\n\nTRAVEL EXPECTATIONS\n\nAlthough this role is remote, you may be expected to travel up to once per quarter for team offsites or key industry events.\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nThe base salary range for this role is $105,000 - $125,000 in local currency. This range reflects the varying levels of expertise and responsibilities that will be determined through the interview process, based on applied experience and other criteria established by the hiring committee.\n\n\nHIRING JOURNEY\n\nAt FutureFit AI, our hiring process is designed to help you assess whether this role and our culture are the right fit based on your unique skills, mindset, and experiences. We move fast and work with intensity, so we want you to get a real sense of that from the start.\n\nEach journey includes a mix of interviews and a performance challenge. For this role, that might look like:\n\n 1. Online Application\n\n 2. Initial Screen with Director of People & Culture\n\n 3. Interview with Hiring Manager\n\n 4. Performance Challenge\n\n 5. Presentation to Go-To-Market panel\n\n 6. 1:1 Interviews with Growth Team\n\n 7. Final Interview with CEO\n\n 8. Final Decision\n\nGenerally, this entire process takes around 6 weeks, although the timing can vary due to specific candidate and team circumstances."},"descriptionClosing":{"html":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Ready to shape the future of work?</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At FutureFit AI, we're not just building a company—we're transforming how talent and opportunity connect.
