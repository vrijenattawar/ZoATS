2. Your resume mentions 'stakeholder management'—could you walk us through a situation where you navigated conflicting priorities among C-level executives? What was your approach and what did you learn?

3. We noticed a 6-month gap between your roles at TechCorp and ConsultCo. Could you help us understand what you were focused on during that time and how it relates to your consulting trajectory?
