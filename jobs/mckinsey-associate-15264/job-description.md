Do you want to work on complex and pressing challenges—the kind that bring together curious, ambitious, and determined leaders who strive to become better every day? **If this sounds like you, you’ve come to the right place.**

Your Impact
-----------

As a consultant, you will work closely with senior client executives and McKinsey colleagues in the most entrepreneurial environments and help to develop sector-shaping and nation-transforming programs.

Your colleagues at McKinsey will go to extraordinary lengths to ensure your success. You will assist, learn from, challenge, and be challenged by leaders. We will constantly invest in your personal development through daily coaching and mentoring coupled with comprehensive training programs that begin soon after you join and continue throughout your McKinsey career.

Our consultants share a passion for helping clients to change industries, transform business models, and create competitive advantages. We advise some of the largest, most innovative companies in a variety of industries, including oil and gas, metals and mining, telecommunications, retail, banking and finance.

You will work in our Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, or Auckland office. With over 50-years experience in Australia and New Zealand, our work spans multiple sectors of the economy including the social sector. We are ambitious for our clients - we want to work with them as they strive for world-class performance.

Driving lasting impact and building long-term capabilities with our clients is not easy work. You are the kind of person who thrives in a high performance/high reward culture - doing hard things, picking yourself up when you stumble, and having the resilience to try another way forward.

In return for your drive, determination, and curiosity, we'll provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities you need to become a stronger leader faster than you ever thought possible. Your colleagues—at all levels—will invest deeply in your development, just as much as they invest in delivering exceptional results for clients. Every day, you'll receive apprenticeship, coaching, and exposure that will accelerate your growth in ways you won’t find anywhere else.

When you join us, you will have:

* **Continuous learning:** Our learning and apprenticeship culture, backed by structured programs, is all about helping you grow while creating an environment where feedback is clear, actionable, and focused on your development. The real magic happens when you take the input from others to heart and embrace the fast-paced learning experience, owning your journey.
* **A voice that matters:** From day one, we value your ideas and contributions. You’ll make a tangible impact by offering innovative ideas and practical solutions. We not only encourage diverse perspectives, but they are critical in driving us toward the best possible outcomes.
* **Global community:** With colleagues across 65+ countries and over 100 different nationalities, our firm’s diversity fuels creativity and helps us come up with the best solutions for our clients. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to learn from exceptional colleagues with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
* **World-class benefits:** On top of a competitive salary (based on your location, experience, and skills), we provide a comprehensive benefits package to enable holistic well-being for you and your family.
